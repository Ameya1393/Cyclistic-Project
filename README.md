# Cyclistic-Project

## Project Description:
This project provides a comprehensive description of the key milestones and actions undertaken throughout the Cyclistic Project, which I successfully completed as part of the Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

## Scenario: 
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your
recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# AIM: To answer the following three questions using the data provided
## Three questions that will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## I answered the above-mentioned questions using these three tools:
1) Excel
2) SQL using BigQuery
3) Data Visualization

## Excel-
I opened my spreadsheet application and followed these steps:

1) I ensured that columns were made consistent and combined into a single worksheet where relevant.
2) I cleaned and transformed the data to prepare it for analysis.
3) I conducted a descriptive analysis of the data.
4) I ran calculations in one file to gain a better understanding of the data layout. Specifically, I calculated the mean of ride_length, the maximum ride_length, and the mode of day_of_week.
5) I created pivot tables to quickly calculate and visualize the data. For instance, I calculated the average ride_length for members and casual riders, as well as the average ride_length for users by day_of_week. I also calculated the number of rides for users by day_of_week.
6) I opened another file and performed the same descriptive analysis steps, exploring different seasons to make initial observations.

After working with the individual spreadsheets, I merged them into a full-year view.
Finally, I exported a summary file for further analysis.

## SQL- 
I opened BigQuery and proceeded with the following steps:

1) I imported the excel sheets into the database.
2) I began by exploring the data, examining the total number of rows, distinct values, as well as calculating the maximum, minimum, and mean values for relevant columns.
To consolidate relevant data, I utilized JOIN statements to combine various tables into a unified table.
3) Afterward, I created summary statistics to gain a comprehensive overview of the dataset.
4) During my analysis, I identified interesting trends and saved this valuable information into a separate table for future reference.
